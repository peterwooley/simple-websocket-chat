# Simple WebSocket Chat
I was curious how much work a WebSocket-only chat app would take. As it turns out, not much. With this app, you can fire up two tabs (or have a second person help using their own machine) and send messages back and forth using WebSockets (care of Socket.IO). All messages are transmitted via WebSockets and no data is stored.

It's lean man, lean.
